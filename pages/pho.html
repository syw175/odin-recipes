        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook the mirepoix.</strong> To a medium stockpot over medium heat, add the olive oil and shallots. Cook the shallots for approximately 5 minutes, stirring often. Add the white parts of a few green onions, the minced garlic, and ginger. Stir well to combine and cook for 1-2 more minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Add pre-made broth or stock.</strong> Add your favorite store-bought broth or stock to the pot and bring to a simmer.</li>
            <li><strong>Add some flavor.</strong> Add 1-2 whole star anise, soy sauce, and fish sauce to the broth. Cover. Simmer for 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Remove the star anise.</strong> Try not to forget this part.</li>
            <li><strong>Season to taste.</strong> When it comes to Pho, you do you. Add more salt, more sugar, more fish sauce, etc.</li>

        </ol>
